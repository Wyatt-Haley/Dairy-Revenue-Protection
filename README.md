# Dairy-Revenue-Protection
Dairy Revenue Protection (Dairy-RP) is a subsidized quarterly revenue insurance availed to producers. This program uses futures milk prices and a declared amount of milk marketing from the quarter to insure expected revenue. There are producer selected terms like most insurance to increase or decrease the coverage on this expected revenue. Increasing coverage increases price of the policy, and the higher the coverage level the lower the subsided amount. This project wants to re visit the price of the policy and subsided amount versus the indemnified amount. 

# About
Dairy-RP was introduced in 2018 and is designed to help producers combat the volatile fluid milk market. Dairy-RP requires numerous choices by a producer when selecting a policy. When purchasing Dairy RP, the producer must first select which quarter (Jan-Mar, Apr-Jun, July-Sept, Oct-Dec) they would like to insure. Policies can be purchased five quarters in the future and are available up until the day before the quarter. Producers then select their pricing option of Class Pricing or Component Pricing and declare a total fluid milk weight for the quarter to insure, with the minimum being 2,000 pounds. Additionally, the producer will select their coverage levels (80%, 85%, 90%, 95%) and a protection factor (1-1.5), which play a role in calculating the liability and expected revenue. Producers can receive an indemnity payment if the actual revenue is less than the expected revenue.
